This module is a forked version of the Boost string algorithms library (Boost
V1.72.0). The library is unchanged except for moving entities to the
``hpx::string`` namespace. All credit goes to the original developers. All bugs
have been introduced by us.

See the :ref:`API reference <libs_string_api>` of this module for more
details.
